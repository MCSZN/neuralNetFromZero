# neuralNetFromZero
This repo is for experimenting and testing neural nets made from scratch. Used code base from Andrew Ng and tweaked it.
One can always change the cost functions and neural architecture of the network to vary. 
However the code base still only uses fully connected layers one could also implement CNN, RNN or even NEAT.
