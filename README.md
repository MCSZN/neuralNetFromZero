# Plain vanilla neural network from zero

This repo is for experimenting and testing neural nets made from scratch.

You can change the cost functions and neural architecture of the network whether you want to do regression or classification tasks. 

You can also choose whether you want the network to be a ResNet or a regular fully connected network.

Goal is to develop various versions for different languages.
